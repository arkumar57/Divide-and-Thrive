## About The Application

**What is the purpose of the application?**
- The purpose is to create an application which will keep track of the daily or weekly tasks of the Home/apartment to be done in general.
- The application will help in listing down all the daily/ weekly tasks and will use an *algorithm* to distribute the tasks between members.
- Once a member does a task, he/she can mark as done.
- If a Task is not done on time by the designated member, he or she will be fined accordingly.

Who will use it?
- This app can generally be useful for students who share apartments with fellow students.
- This app can also be useful to family where home tasks are distributed.
- This app can also serve as useful in accommodations where people share tasks among them.

Why is this project of Interest to you?
- I personally live in a shared apartment and often come across the conflict upon the completion of shared task.
- Using this app will make the mutual tasks interesting as every single member will get a random new task and hence it will them to build up their skill set.
